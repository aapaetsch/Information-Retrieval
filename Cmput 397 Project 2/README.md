# Don't Forget to

1. Write the URL of your repository on eClass **as soon as you read this line**. Do not submit yet, you will need to report the participation of your teammates.
1. Disclose all sources you consult
1. Spend time on your design; you need to break down the tasks so that all team members can work in parallel
1. Meet with the TA about your group progress and to ask for advice
1. Test your code
1. Document any assumptions and design decisions
1. Add clear execution instructions

We stemmed our tokenization and removed stopwords in order to create an abstract that had as many identifying terms as possible. Also, in order to provide a better user experience, we print out certain steps along the way in order to show progress. We assume that testing and grading will be done on the sets that were given for the assignment, as our weights, features, and k are all based off of this. All of our py files are run from this directory, by calling them using the steps in their READMEs. Design decisions are noted within the specific algorithms' READMEs. Tests are also noted with the READMEs.

Ensure NLTK is installed on the computer prior to running the algorithms. The rest is handled by the individual algorithms. Install NLTK by running `pip3 install nltk`
